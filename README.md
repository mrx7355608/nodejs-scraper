# Nodejs Scraper
Built a nodejs web scraper with:
- Cheerio
- Request-promise

> **Note:**
Amazon scraper is just a hack which extracts data from amazon with the help of DOM manipulation in JavaScript

## Getting started

First install all dependencies from npm
```
npm install
```
Add the urls you want to scrape in `czoneScraper.js` file
> **Important!** Have a look at the links provided in the script to know what type of links are required! Incorrect links will cause issues.

After all the things are setup

Run the `czoneScraper.js` file with a simple nodejs command
```
node czoneScraper.js
```
